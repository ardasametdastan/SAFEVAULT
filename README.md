## Getting Started

This project implements secure coding practices to prevent SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities. Additionally, it includes authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### Prerequisites:
- .NET 6.0 or later
- Visual Studio or any IDE
- SQL Server or another relational database server

### Running the Project:
1. Clone the repository from **GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/safevault.git
   ```

2. **Configure the Database Connection**:
   Update the `appsettings.json` file with your own SQL Server connection string.

3. **Install Project Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to restore the dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Apply Database Migrations**:
   To create the database schema and apply the initial migration, run:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   To start the application, use the following command:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Project Structure

- **Controllers**: Web API controllers and related business logic
- **Models**: User models and database relationships
- **Services**: Application's business logic and service classes
- **Tests**: Unit tests for security vulnerabilities
- **appsettings.json**: Configuration settings such as database connection strings and JWT settings

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: The framework used to build the web application.
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database management.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure token-based authentication and authorization.
- **SQL Server**: Database management system.
- **XUnit/NUnit**: Test frameworks used for unit testing.

## Security

This project implements the following security measures:

1. **SQL Injection**: SQL queries are secured using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. **XSS (Cross-site Scripting)**: User inputs are sanitized to prevent malicious script injections.
3. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure token-based authentication is implemented for user verification.

### Security Notes:
- Sensitive information like **JWT Secret Key** should not be stored directly in the `appsettings.json` file in production. Use environment variables or a secure storage solution instead.
- The applicationâ€™s database should be correctly configured to prevent SQL injection attacks.

## Tests

This project includes tests to ensure the application is secure against SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

### Running Tests:
To run the tests, use the following command:
1. Run the tests with NUnit or XUnit:
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

2. You can check the test results in the terminal or within Visual Studio.
